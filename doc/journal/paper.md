# Does a present bias influence exploratory choice?

# Exploration outside the lab

Exploration has been studied outside the lab in a wide range of contexts. While
these domains vary greatly in their superficial characteristics, a bias towards
under-exploration has often been observed.

Learned helplessness, a phenomenon applicable to many behaviors and domains, has
been described as an example of insufficient exploration. In learned
helplessness, an organism experiences the absence of control over the
environment, learns that the environment is uncontrollable, and thus ceases to
take actions that might allow it to discover that it can in fact exert control.
Learned helplessness has been proposed to underly some forms of depression
[@Abramson1978; @Abramson1989] as well as problems ranging from difficulties in
school [@Diener1978] to poverty [@Evans2005]. While the cognitive appraisal of
experienced events affects the development of learned helplessness
[@Abramson1978], patterns of exploration clearly play a role as well [@Huys2009,
@Teodorescu2014a]. In the case of depression, interventions aimed at increasing
the exploration of activities that might be rewarding have been found to be as
effective as those with a more cognitive orientation [@Jacobson1996].

Under-exploration also seems to occur in the development of complex skills, such
as flying a plane or playing a sport [@Gopher1989]. In these settings, an "emphasis
change" training method that encourages people to continually explore the
performance space leads to greater performance gains than unguided practice or more complex
training methods.  Without this intervention, people often enter a "local
maximum" in which exploration decreases and performance plateaus [@Yechiam2001].

In many other areas under-exploration is less clearly
established, but is suspected to play a role in maladaptive behavior.
Insufficient exploratory interaction with outgroups may be one cause of
stereotypes and prejudice [@Denrell2005most], and interventions that
increase inter-group contact reduce stereotypes [@Shook2008]. The crowding
out of exploration by exploitation is a concern in organizational behavior as
well [@March1991; @Levinthal1993], prompting research into organizational
structures that may preserve exploration [@Fang2010].

# Exploration in the lab

Lab studies of exploratory choice have allowed researchers to fully
control the reward structure of the environment and precisely measure behavior,
as well as comparing behavior to optimal patterns of choice and other formal models.
These studies have yielded a number of insights into the factors leading to more
or less exploration, including aspiration levels [@Wulff2015], uncertainty
[@Speekenbrink2015], and the future value of information [@Rich2017; @Wilson2014a]

Interestingly, under-exploration has not emerged as a clear pattern in lab
experiments. Instead, results are mixed with people sometimes under-exploring,
sometimes over-exploring, and sometimes exploring close to an optimal amount. To
take two illustrative examples, [@Zwick2003] found that in a sequential
search task people under-searched when there were no information costs but
over-searched when there were information costs, and [@Teodorescu2014]
found that people explored unknown alternatives too often or not often enough
depending on whether rare outcomes were positive or negative. Similar results
have been obtained within and across a variety of other studies and paradigms
[@tversky1966information; @hertwig2004decisions; @Navarro2016; @Juni2016;
@Sang2011].

These experimental studies raise the question of why under-exploration appears
more widespread in the field, but not in the lab. One possibility is that both
forms of deviation from optimality are in fact prevalent, though perhaps in
different settings, and that the seemingly general bias toward under-exploration
is illusory. An alternative is that there are some important aspects of real-world
decisions&mdash;or peoples' cognitive and motivational states when making those
decisions&mdash;that makes differentiate them from decisions in the lab. In the
current paper, we investigate one potential missing component of lab tests of
exploratory choice: the distribution of choices and outcomes over time. We
propose and test the hypothesis that because of people's bias towards immediate
rewards, the spreading of choices over time may account for a portion of
people's tendency to under-explore.

## Formal analysis

## Capturing present bias in the lab

# Experiment
## Methods

### Participants.

### Design and procedure.

#### Barratt Impulsiveness Scale

Prior to reading the experiment instructions, participants completed the 30-item
Barratt Impulsiveness scale [@Patton1995] on the computer. 

#### Consumption tasks.

Participants were informed that there were two types of tasks, a "slider task"
and a "video task," that they would complete during 30-second "work periods."
The number of remaining work periods in the experiment was shown at the top of
the screen, as was the number of seconds left in the current work period.

The slider task was based of a task previously used by [@Gill2012]. In each
period of the slider task, five horizontal sliders appeared on the screen
(Figure XXX). Each started at a random setting between 0 and 100, with the
slider's value shown to its right, and with a random horizontal offset so that
the sliders were not aligned. The participant's task was to use the mouse to
move each slider to "50" before the work period ended. When a participant
released the mouse at the correct setting, the slider turned green to show it
had been completed. To ensure that the task took close to the allotted 30
seconds, at the beginning of the task only the top slider was enabled, and the
other four were grayed out. Additional sliders were enabled at five-second
intervals, such that all five sliders were available after 20 seconds. To make
the slider task more unpleasant, a short static noise was played through the computer
speakers intermittently at a moderate volume during the task.

The video tasks consisted of simply watching one of four videos: an episode of
"Planet Earth", and episode of "The Great British Bakeoff", and episode of
"Unchained Reactions", or an Ellen Degeneres comedy special. Participants
watched the video through a player on the computer screen. They were free to
fast forward or rewind the video at will, and could also switch among the videos
at any time by clicking one of four tabs above the player.

To incentivize participants to attend to and perform the slider task, they were
penalized if they missed more than 10% of the sliders. For each percentage over
10% of sliders that were not set to 50 over the course of the experiment, $.20
was deducted from a bonus that started at $5.00. For example, if a participant
failed to set the sliders to 50 for 18% of sliders, their final bonus would be
$3.40.

#### Choice task.

Participants completed a total of 56 work periods. The first eight were
automatically spent performing the slider task. For the remaining 48,
participants made a choice prior to each work period that determined whether the
work period would be devoted to the slider task or the video task.

For the choice task, participants were shown a "machine" that could create
slider or video tasks. The machine consisted of a black-and-gold "best" spinner and a
panel of possible new spinners. Participants selected either "run best spinner"
or "run new spinner".

If the participant selected "run best spinner", the spinner would visually
rotate on the screen. If it landed on gold, the machine created a video task; if
it landed on black, the machine created a slider task. Thus, the probability of
producing a video task was equal to the proportion gold of the spinner.

If the participant selected "run new spinner", the new spinners in the panel
were covered up and randomly shuffled. The participant then clicked one of the
gray squares, revealing the new spinner underneath. As was explained to the
particpants, and is visually apparent, one third of the possible new spinners
are completely black, while the remaining two thirds range from 5% to 100% gold,
in even increments of 5%.

After revealing a new spinner, it was spun, producing a video or slider task in
the same manner as the "best spinner". Critically, if the new spinner selected had
a higher proportion gold than the best spinner, it would replace the best
spinner for future choices. Thus, choosing "run new spinner" was an exploratory
action that could lead to the discovery of a better option that could be
exploited in later choices.

Participants were also informed that after every work period there was a one in
six chance that the machine would reset itself. In fact, the experiment was
designed so that there was exactly one reset in every set of 6 trials (i.e.,
trials 1&ndash;6, 7&ndash;12, etc.). When the machine reset, the "best
spinner" was set to a new starting value. The starting values following resets
(including the intial starting value) were {20%, 25%, &hellip; 55%, 60%}, randomly
ordered.

#### Immediate and delayed conditions.

Participants were pseudorandomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the
Immediate condition, participants completed the task produced by a choice in the
work period immediately following the choice. In the Delayed condition,
participants completed the task produced by a choice after eight intervening
work periods had passed, which was about five minutes after making the choice.
This means that participants in the Delayed condition began making choices
during the initial eight slider task work periods, in order to have outcomes
determined when they reached the ninth and later work periods.

To make this delay intuitive, participants were shown a work queue at the bottom
of the screen that contained eight tasks. In the Delayed condition, upon making
a choice a new slider or video task icon was added to the right of the queue,
and then the leftmost task on the queue was performed and removed. In the
Immediate condition, participants were still shown the cue, but upon adding an
icon to the right of the queue that outcome was performed immediately. This
means that in the Immediate condition the queue acted simply as a history of the
past eight outcomes.

#### Post-task questions.

Following the final work period, participants were asked to rate their enjoyment
of the slider task and of the video task on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1
indicated extremely unenjoyable and 7 indicated extremely enjoyable.
