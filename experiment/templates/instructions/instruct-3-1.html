            In the final part of the experiment, you will continue to play the
            same card game with 6 contexts. But now, instead of simply receiving
            between 0 and 12 points after each outcome, the points you receive
            will determine the content of a short <strong>outcome phase</strong>
            after each outcome.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each outcome phase lasts 36 seconds total. For each point you
            receive, you will get 3 seconds to play a version of the game
            "breakout". For example, if you receive 4 points, you will get
            to play breakout for 12 of the 36 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            In breakout, you use your mouse to control the position of a paddle
            near the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to bounce a ball into rows of bricks to
            destroy them, without letting the ball fall out of the bottom of the
            screen. You will gain a point for each brick you destroy, and new bricks
            will appear when you clear the entire screen.
        </p>
