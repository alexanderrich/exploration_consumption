            In the final phase of the experiment, you will continue to play the
            same card game with 6 contexts. But now, instead of the outcome on
            the chosen card producing points that directly convert to a monetary
            bonus, the outcome of the card will determine the content of a short
            <strong>outcome phase</strong> after each outcome.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each outcome phase lasts 36 seconds in total, and the time left in the
            phase will be displayed at the top of the screen. You will get 3 seconds
            times your chosen card's outcome to play a version of the game "breakout".
            For example, if you receive an outcome of 4, you will get to play breakout
            for 12 of the 36 seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            In breakout, you use your mouse to control the position of a paddle
            near the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to bounce a ball into rows of bricks to
            destroy them, without letting the ball fall out of the bottom of the
            screen. You will gain a point for each brick you destroy, and new bricks
            will appear when you clear the entire screen. In addition, when a
            brick is destroyed it will occasionally produce a "+3" bonus brick
            that will fall down the screen. Catch this brick with your paddle
            for an extra 3 points!
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the experiment, points scored in breakout will be
            converted into a cash bonus using the same rate of 1 cent per 10 points
            introduced in the previous phase. This bonus will be added to your
            bonus from the previous phase.
