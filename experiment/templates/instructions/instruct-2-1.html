            In the next part of the experiment, you will continue to play the
            card game introduced in the first part. However, rather than playing
            straight through trials of one card game, you will cycle through
            trials of 6 separate card games in 6 <strong>contexts</strong>: the
            <span style="color: red">red</span>,
            <span style="color: orange">orange</span>,
            <span style="color: yellow">yellow</span>,
            <span style="color: green">green</span>,
            <span style="color: blue">blue</span>, and
            <span style="color: purple">purple</span>
            contexts.
        </p>

	      <p>
            On the lower half of the screen, a map will show the layout of the 6
            contexts. The number in each context box shows the current
            sure-thing card in that context. The black-and-white character icon
            shows your current context. After completing a trial and receiving
            an outcome, the icon will move clockwise to the next context and
            begin a trial with the cards in that context. The cards in the 6
            contexts are completely separate, and your choices and outcomes in
            one context will not affect the outcomes in another context.
