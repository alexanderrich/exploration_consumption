            On some trials, a set of smaller colored squares will appear on the
            map between the contexts. When your icon passes one of these
            squares, you will be asked to make an <strong>advanced
            choice</strong> for the context matching that color. This means you
            will be shown the context matching that color, and be asked to
            commit to either choosing the best-yet card or the mystery card on
            your next trial in that context.
        </p>
        <p>
            After making an advanced choice, a small "a" will appear under that
            context on the map to indicate that a choice has already been made.
            When you reach that context, rather than making a choice, you will
            simply complete the choice you made earlier and receive its outcome.
            Advanced choices always occur 4 trials ahead of when the context
            will next be reached.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this part of the experiment, points you receive from your choices
            will be converted into a cash bonus received at the end of the
            experiment. Points will be converted into money at a rate of 1 cent
            for each 10 points.
        </p>
