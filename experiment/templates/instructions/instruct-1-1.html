            This experiment will consist of 3 parts. The total experiment will
            take about <strong>80 minutes</strong> to complete. If you do not
            have time to complete this HIT with minimal interruption, please
            return the HIT.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the first phase of the experiment, you play a simple game. On
            each trial of the game, you will have to choose between a "best-yet"
            card on the left, and a "mystery" card on the right. Your goal is to
            maximize your total points. Earned points and trials remaining in
            the phase are displayed at the top of the screen.

        <p>
            To choose a card, simply click on it to select it. Then click the
            box titled "click for outcome" to reveal the number of points you've
            earned and to move on to the next trial.

        <p>
            If you choose the best-yet card, you will get the number of points
            printed on it. If you choose the mystery card, you will reveal its
            value and get the number of points printed on it. In addition, if
            its value is higher than the current best-yet card, it will replace
            that card for future trials. This means that finding a high-value
            card can increase your points on future trials. If you choose the
            mystery card, a new one will appear on the next trial.
