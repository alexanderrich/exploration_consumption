            Before proceeding to the complete game,
            you will perform several trials of the decision-making game without
            the arcade phases. You can use this opportunity to get a better
            sense of how the game works and of the spread of cards in the decks.
        </p>

        <p>
            After practicing the decision-making game, you will proceed to a few
            practice rounds of the arcade phase, which will allow you to get a
            sense of how brickbreak and the popup-clicking task work. You will
            not be penalized for popups missed during the practice phase.
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing the practice rounds, you will proceed to the main game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember, your choices in the decision-making game determine the
            amount of time you get to play brickbreak during the arcade phases
            after each room visit. Enjoy the game, and be sure to click the
            popups to receive your full $3.00 bonus!
