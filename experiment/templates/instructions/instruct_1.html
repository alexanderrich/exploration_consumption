            This experiment will consist of 3 parts. The total experiment will
            take about <strong>60 minutes</strong> to complete. If you do not
            have time to complete this HIT with minimal interruption, please
            return the HIT.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this experiment, you will perform a simple decision-making task.
            After each choice in this task, you will complete a 36-second
            "outcome phase." The outcomes of your choices will determine how
            much time in the outcome phase is spent playing an arcade game
            versus performing a monotonous clicking activity.

            In the instructions that follow, we will first explain the rules of
            the decision-making task, and then explain the contents of the
            outcome phase.
