            This experiment will take about <strong>60 minutes</strong> to complete. <strong>If you do not
            have time to complete this HIT with minimal interruption, or could
            not comfortably play a mouse-based video game for that amount
            of time, please return the HIT.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            In this experiment, you will be acting as a worker who must perform
            a simple but monotonous task. However, throughout the experiment you
            will make choices that can reduce your time spent on the task and
            allow you to play a game instead.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your task is to adjust sliders to "50". Your work will be split into
            30-second work periods. In each work period, five sliders will
            appear on the screen. Your job is simply to move each one to "50"
            using the mouse within the allotted 30 seconds. When the slider is
            released at 50 it will turn green, showing that it has been
            successfully completed.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the beginning of each work period, only the first slider will be
            enabled and the other four will be grayed out. As the period
            progresses, the other sliders will be enabled at 5 second intervals.
            This means that in each period you must start with the first slider
            and work your way down. When the final slider is enabled, you will
            have a total of ten seconds remaining to complete the sliders.
        </p>

        <p>
            The time left in the current work period, number of work periods
            remaining in the experiment, and percentage of sliders missed over
            the experiment will be displayed at the top of the screen.
