            In this experiment, we are looking at how people make decisions to
            trade off between fun and boring activities. At the beginning of the
            experiment, you will be given a boring and monotonous task to perform.
            However, throughout the experiment you will make choices that can
            allow you to "get out of" the boring task and watch a Youtube video instead.
        </p>

            Your task is simply to adjust sliders to "50". Your work will be split into
            30-second work periods. In each period, five sliders will
            appear on the screen. Your job is to move each one to "50"
            using the mouse within the allotted 30 seconds. When the slider is
            released at 50 it will turn green, showing that it has been
            completed.

        <p>
            At the beginning of each work period, only the first slider will be
            enabled and the other four will be grayed out. As the period
            progresses, the other sliders will be enabled at 5 second intervals.
        </p>

        <p>
            The time left in the current work period, number of work periods
            remaining in the experiment, and percentage of sliders missed over
            the course of the experiment will be displayed at the top of the screen.
