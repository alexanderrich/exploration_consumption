            This experiment will take about <strong>60 to 70 minutes</strong> to complete. <strong>If you do not
            have time to complete this HIT with minimal interruption, or could
            not comfortably play a mouse-based video game for that amount
            of time, please return the HIT.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            In this experiment, you will be acting as a worker who must perform
            a simple but monotonous task. However, throughout the experiment you will
            have opportunities to make choices that can reduce your time spent
            on the task and allow you to play a game instead.
        </p>

            Your task is to adjust sliders to "50". Your work will be split into
            30 second periods. In each period, five sliders will appear on the
            screen. Your job is simply to move each one to "50" using the mouse
            within the allotted 30 seconds. When the slider is released at 50 it
            will turn green, showing that it has been successfully completed.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the beginning of each work period, only the first slider will be enabled and
            the other four will be grayed out. As the period progresses, the other sliders
            will be enabled at 5 second intervals. This means that in each period you must
            start with the first slider and work your way down. When the final slider is
            enabled, you will have a total of ten seconds remaining to complete the sliders.
