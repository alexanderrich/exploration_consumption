            This experiment will take about <strong>60 to 70 minutes</strong> to complete. <strong>If you do not
            have time to complete this HIT with minimal interruption, or could
            not comfortably play a simple mouse-based video game for that amount
            of time, please return the HIT.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            In this experiment, you will play a simple decision-making game.
            Each choice in this game will be followed by a short "arcade
            phase," in which you will either play an arcade game or perform a
            monotonous clicking activity depending on the outcome of your
            choice.
        </p>

            In the instructions that follow, we will first explain the rules of
            the decision-making game, and then explain the
            arcade phase.
