            At the beginning of the game, the value of the best-yet card always
            starts at 4. When you take a mystery card, there is a 50% chance
            that its value is 0, and a 50% chance that its value is a random
            number between 4 and 12. This means that while taking the mystery
            card can sometimes cause you to miss out on points, it can also lead
            to a big improvement in the best-yet card.
        </p>

            Finally, after each trial there is a <strong>1 in 8</strong> (12.5%)
            chance that the cards will reset. When this occurs, you will see the
            phrase "cards reset", and the best-yet card will be reset to 4.
        </p>

            In this first phase, there is no monetary bonus for performance. You
            should simply try to get a feel for the game, with the goal of
            maximizing your total points.
