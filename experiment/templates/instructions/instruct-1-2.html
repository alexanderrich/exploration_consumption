            At the beginning of the game, the value of the best-yet card always
            starts at a value between 4 and 7. When you choose a mystery
            card, there is a 50% chance that its value is 0, and a 50% chance
            that its value is a random number between 4 and 12. This means that
            while taking the mystery card can sometimes cause you to miss out on
            points, it can also lead to a big improvement in the best-yet card.

            Finally, after each trial there is a <strong>1 in 10</strong> (10%)
            chance that the cards will reset. When this occurs, you will see the
            phrase "cards reset", and the best-yet card will be reset to a
            random value between 4 and 7.

            In this first phase, there is no monetary bonus for performance. You
            should simply try to get a feel for the game, with the goal of
            maximizing your total points.
