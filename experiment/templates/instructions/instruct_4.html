            If you try a new setting, a random wedge will be created in the new
            setting spinner. One third (33%) of the time, the attempt to create a new
            setting will fail and the wedge will take up 0% of the spinner, meaning the
            machine will not work. The other two thirds (67%) of the time, a new gold wedge
            will be created that takes up between one third (33%) of the spinner and the
            entire spinner (100%). After the new setting is created, the machine will run
            the new setting. Additionally, if the new setting is better than the current
            setting, it will be <strong>saved</strong> and will become the current setting
            the next time you use the machine. This means that while running a new setting
            can be risky, it can also allow you to improve the machines so they are more
            likely to work in the future.
