            Once you click an idle machine, it will appear at the top of the screen.
            Each machine has a "current setting" button and spinner, a "new
            setting" button and spinner, and a screen on the right that displays
            useful information and instructions.
        </p>

        <p>
            To use the machine, you can choose to run the current setting or to try a new
            setting. The gold wedge in the current setting spinner represents the chance of
            the machine working and completing the sliders for you. If you select the
            current setting spinner, it will spin and the machine will work if the arrow
            lands on the gold wedge. The current setting wedge on each machine starts as a
            random proportion between one third (33%) and two thirds (67%) of the spinner.
