            <strong>Call-ahead choices:</strong> A set of smaller colored
            squares will sometimes appear on the map between the rooms. When
            your character passes one of these "call-ahead booths", you will
            "call the dealer" in the room matching the booth's color and have to
            make your choice in advance. This means you will be shown the room
            matching that color, and be asked to click to commit to either
            choosing the best-yet card or a card from the deck on your next
            visit to the room. When you reach the room, rather than making a
            choice, you will simply click to reveal the outcome of the choice
            you called in earlier. Call-ahead choices always occur 4 rooms ahead
            of when the room will next be reached. Rooms where your choice has
            been called ahead will have a small telephone icon below them on the
            room map.
