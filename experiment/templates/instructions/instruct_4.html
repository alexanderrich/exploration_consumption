        <p>
            After receiving each outcome, you will complete a short <strong>outcome phase</strong>.
            Each outcome phase lasts 36 seconds total. During this phase, you
            will get a number of seconds equal to your received outcome to play
            an arcade game called "brickbreak". For example, if you receive an
            outcome of 15, you will get to play brickbreak for 15 of the 36 seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            In brickbreak, you use your mouse to control the position of a paddle
            near the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to bounce a ball into rows of bricks to
            destroy them, without letting the ball fall out of the bottom of the
            screen. You will gain a point for each brick you destroy. In addition, when a
            brick is destroyed it will occasionally produce a "+3" bonus brick
            that will fall down the screen. Catch this brick with your paddle
            for an extra 3 points!
        </p>

        <p>
            Your total points will be tallied in the upper left corner of the
            screen. Each time you complete a level (by destroying all of
            the bricks), a new pattern of bricks will appear, bringing new
            challenges and strategies.
