            You will receive a <strong>bonus of $5.00</strong> simply for
            completing the sliders and holding space to watch the video. If you occasionally do not set a
            slider to 50 or do not watch the video, you will not be penalized and will receive your complete bonus.
            However, <strong>you will be penalized 20 cents from your bonus for each
            percentage of sliders over 10% that you miss. You will also be penalized 10 cents for each
            percentage of video pause time over 20%</strong>.
            For example, if you miss 13% of the sliders, and leave the video paused for 25% of the time, you will lose
            $1.60 and your final bonus will be $3.40. These penalties are simply to ensure that you remain engaged with the tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before completing the main experiment, you will first complete a
            practice task where the actual work periods have been removed. You can use this
            opportunity to get a better sense of how the machine works and practice using
            it.
        </p>

        <p>
            After practicing using the machine, you will practice
            the slider task and video task. You will not be penalized for
            sliders missed or pause time during this practice phase.
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing the practice rounds, you will proceed to the main experiment.
