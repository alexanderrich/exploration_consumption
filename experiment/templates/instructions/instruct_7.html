            You will receive a <strong>bonus of $3.00</strong> simply for accurately
            completing the slider work periods. If you occasionally do not accurately set a
            slider to 50, you will not be penalized and will receive your complete bonus
            However, <strong>you will be penalized 10 cents from your bonus for each
            percentage of sliders over 10% that you miss</strong>. For example, if you miss
            23% of the sliders throughout the entire task, you will lose $1.30 and your
            final bonus will be $1.70.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before proceeding to the complete task, you will first complete a shortened
            practice task where the actual work periods have been removed. You can use this
            opportunity to get a better sense of how the machines work and practice using
            them.
        </p>

        <p>
            After practicing using the machines, you will proceed to a few practice periods
            of the slider task and the Brickbreak game. You will not be penalized for
            sliders missed during this practice phase.
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing the practice rounds, you will proceed to the main task.
