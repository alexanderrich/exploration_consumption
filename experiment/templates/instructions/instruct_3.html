            Once the six machines are available, they will be displayed at the
            bottom of the screen before each work period, with the currently
            ready-to-use machine circled. Each machine has a "current setting"
            button and spinner, a "new setting" button and spinner, and a screen
            on the right that displays useful information and instructions.
        </p>

        <p>
            To use the machine, you can choose to run the current setting or to try a new
            setting. The gold wedge in the current setting spinner represents the chance of
            the machine working and completing the sliders for you. If you select the
            current setting spinner, it will spin and the machine will work if the arrow
            lands on the gold wedge. The current setting wedge on each machine starts as a
            random proportion between one third (33%) and two thirds (67%) of the spinner.
