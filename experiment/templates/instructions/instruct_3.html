            <strong>Context resets:</strong> After each outcome, there is a 1 in
            6 (17%) chance that the context will reset, meaning that the best-yet
            card will be set back to a random value between 12 and 18.

        <p>
            <strong>Advanced choices:</strong> A set of smaller
            colored squares may sometimes appear on the map between the contexts. When
            your icon passes one of these squares, you will be asked to make an
            advanced choice for the context matching that
            color. This means you will be shown the context matching that color,
            and be asked to commit to either choosing the best-yet card or the
            mystery card on your next visit to that context. After making an advanced choice, a
            small "a" will appear under that context on the map to indicate that
            a choice has already been made. When you reach that context, rather
            than making a choice, you will simply click to reveal the outcome of
            the choice you committed to earlier. Advanced choices always occur 4 contexts
            ahead of when the context will next be reached.

            <strong>"info" button:</strong> In the lower-right corner of the
            context is a button labeled "info". Press this button to toggle a
            set of reminders about the rules of the decision-making task.
