            In each room you will play a simple card game. On the left you will
            see a face-up "best-yet" card, and on the right you will see a deck
            of face-down cards. You can click the best-yet
            card to take its value, or click the deck to reveal a new card and take its value.
            After choosing, click the "click for outcome" button to see the outcome of your choice.

        <p>
            <strong>One third (33%) of the cards in the deck have a value of 0. The
            other two thirds (67%) have values evenly spread from 12 to 36, in
            multiples of three</strong> (in other words, 12, 15, ... 33, 36). The decks in each room are
            well-shuffled and are large enough that they won't run out of
            any card values. At the beginning of the game, the dealer in each
            room will choose a card with a value of 12, 15, or 18 as the
            starting best-yet card.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you choose the best-yet card, or you choose a card from the deck
            but its value is lower than the best-yet card, then the best-yet
            card will remain the same. But if you pick a card from the deck and
            it's <strong>higher</strong> than the current
            best-yet card, it will <strong>become the new best-yet
            card</strong> for your next visit to the room. This means that choosing a card
            from the deck might sometimes lead to low values, but it can
            also help you in the long run by improving the best-yet card.
