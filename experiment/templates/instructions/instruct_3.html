            <strong>Room resets:</strong> After each visit to a room, there is a 1 in
            6 (17%) chance that the dealer will reset the game, meaning that the best-yet
            card will be set back to a random value between 12 and 18.

            <strong>Call-ahead choices:</strong> A set of smaller colored squares
            will sometimes appear on the map between the rooms. When your
            character passes one of these "call-ahead booths", you will "call
            the dealer" in the room matching the booth's color and have to make your
            choice in advance. This means you will be shown the room matching
            that color, and be asked to click to commit to either choosing the
            best-yet card or a card from the deck on your next visit to the
            room. When you reach the room, rather than making a choice, you
            will simply click to reveal the outcome of the choice you called in
            earlier. Call-ahead choices always occur 4 rooms ahead of when
            the room will next be reached.

            <strong>"info" button:</strong> In the lower-right corner of the
            room map is a button labeled "info". If you forget the rules of the
            game, click this button to toggle a set of reminders.
