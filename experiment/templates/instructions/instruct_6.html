            Before proceeding to the complete task, including the outcome phase,
            you will perform several trial of the decision-making task without
            the outcome phases. You can use this opportunity to get a better
            sense of how the game works and of the spread of possible mystery-card values.
        </p>

        <p>
            After practicing the decision-making task, you will proceed to a few
            practice rounds of the outcome phase, which will allow you to get a
            sense of how brickbreak and the popup-clicking task work. You will
            not be penalized for popups missed during the practice phase.
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing the practice rounds, you will proceed to the main task.
