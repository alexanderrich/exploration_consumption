            After each visit to a room, you will get to play a short <strong>arcade phase</strong>.
            Each arcade phase lasts 36 seconds in total. During this phase, you
            will get a number of seconds equal to the value of your chosen card to play
            an arcade game called "<strong>brickbreak</strong>". For example, if
            your card has a value of 15, you will get to play brickbreak for 15
            of the 36 seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
            In brickbreak, you use your mouse to control the position of a paddle
            near the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to bounce a ball into rows of bricks to
            destroy them, without letting the ball fall out of the bottom of the
            screen. You will gain points for each brick you destroy. In addition, when a
            brick is destroyed it will occasionally produce a "+15" <strong>bonus brick</strong>
            that will fall down the screen. Catch this brick with your paddle
            for an extra 15 points!
        </p>

        <p>
            At any point in the game, you can press the "up" or "down" arrows on
            your keyboard to increase or decrease the speed of the ball.
            Increasing the speed makes the game more challenging, but also gives
            you more points for each brick destroyed! Your total points will be
            tallied in the upper left corner of the screen. Each time you
            complete a level (by destroying all of
            the bricks), a <strong>new pattern</strong> of bricks will appear, bringing new
            challenges and potential strategies.
