            Before proceeding to the complete task, you will first complete a shortened
            practice task where the actual work periods have been removed. You can use this
            opportunity to get a better sense of how the machines work and practice using
            them.
        </p>

        <p>
            After practicing using the machines, you will proceed to a few practice periods
            of the slider task and the Brickbreak game. You will not be penalized for
            sliders missed during this practice phase.
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing the practice rounds, you will proceed to the main task.
