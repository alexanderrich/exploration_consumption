        <p>
            In the decision making task, you will move clockwise through six <strong>contexts</strong>,
            each with a different color. The <strong>context map</strong> at the bottom of the screen shows
            your position in the contexts. Whenever you reach a context, you
            will make a choice and receive an outcome. This outcome corresponds
            to the number of seconds that you will get to play the arcade game
            durint the 36-second outcome phase. The details of the outcome phase
            will be explained later.
        </p>

        <p>
            In each context, you will find two cards: a "<strong>best-yet</strong>" card on the
            left, and a "<strong>mystery</strong>" card on the right. Your task is choose one of
            these cards. Click a card to select it, and then click the button
            marked "click for outcome".
        </p>

        <p>
            The "best-yet" card always produces the outcome printed on it, and
            the context map shows the current best-yet card value in each
            context. The best-yet card starts at a random value between 12 and
            21, in multiples of 3. In other words, it starts at 12, 15, 18, or
            21. The "mystery" card produces a randomly-generated outcome each
            time it is chosen. <strong>One third of the time (33%), it will produce an
            outcome of 0. Two thirds of the time (67%), it will
            produce a random outcome between 12 and 36</strong>, again in multiples of 3. If the mystery card
            produces an outcome higher than the current value of the best-yet card, this
            value will <strong>replace</strong> the value of best-yet card. This
            means that while choosing the mystery card can sometimes produce
            poor outcomes, it can also improve your outcomes in the long run by
            improving the best-yet card.
        </p>

        <p>
            A counter at the top of the screen will inform you of the number of
            outcomes remaining in the experiment.
