            In the decision making task, you will move clockwise through six <strong>contexts</strong>,
            each with a different color. The <strong>context map</strong> at the
            bottom of the screen shows your current position as a stick-figure icon, and
            a counter at the top of the screen shows the number of
            context visits remain in the task.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each time you visit a context, you will make a choice and receive an
            outcome. This outcome corresponds to the number of seconds that you
            will get to play the arcade game during the following 36-second
            outcome phase. The details of the outcome phase will be explained
            later.
        </p>

        <p>
            In each context, you will choose between two cards: a "<strong>best-yet</strong>" card on the
            left, and a "<strong>mystery</strong>" card on the right. Click a
            card to select it, and then click the button marked "click for
            outcome".
        </p>


        <div class="instrimages">
            <img width="700px" src="/static/images/instruct_2_img2.png">
        </div>

        <p>
            The best-yet card always produces the outcome printed on it, and
            the context map shows the current best-yet card value in each
            context. The best-yet card starts at a random value between 12 and
            18, in multiples of 3. In other words, it starts at 12, 15, or 18.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mystery card produces a randomly-generated outcome each
            time it is chosen. <strong>One third of the time (33%), it will produce an
            outcome of 0. Two thirds of the time (67%), it will
            produce a random outcome between 12 and 36</strong>, again in multiples of 3. If the mystery card
            produces an outcome higher than the current value of the best-yet card, this
            value will <strong>replace</strong> the value of best-yet card. This
            means that while choosing the mystery card can sometimes produce
            poor outcomes, it can also improve your outcomes in the long run by
            improving the best-yet card.
