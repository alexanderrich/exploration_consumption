            After a few work periods, you will gain access to six
            machines. These machines won't always work, but when they do
            they will complete the next work period for you. When a machine
            completes a work period for you, you will get to spend the period playing an
            arcade game called Brickbreak.

        <p>
            In Brickbreak, you control a paddle near the bottom of the screen.
            To move the paddle, simply move your mouse anywhere within the game
            screen. Your goal is to bounce a ball into rows of bricks to destroy
            them, without letting the ball fall out of the bottom of the screen.
            You will gain points for each brick you destroy, and can press the
            "up" or "down" arrows on your keyboard to increase or decrease the
            speed of the ball. Destroyed bricks will occasionally create green
            "bonus bricks", which you can catch with your paddle for extra
            points.
