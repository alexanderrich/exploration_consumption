            After a few work periods, you will gain access to six
            machines. These machines won't always work, but when they do
            they will complete the next work period for you. When a machine
            completes a work period for you, you will get to spend the period
            watching a video on Youtube. Before beginning the experiment, you
            will get to choose from four videos: Planet Earth, The Great British
            Bake-off, Mythbusters, and an Ellen Degeneres comedy show.

            When watching the Youtube video, you will have to hold down the
            space bar to play the video. When you release the space bar or
            switch away from the experiment browser window, the video will
            pause. The percent of time when the video has been paused over
            the course of the experiment will be displayed at the top of the screen.
