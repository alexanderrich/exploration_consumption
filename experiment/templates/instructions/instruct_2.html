            In the decision-making game, your character moves clockwise through six <strong>rooms</strong>,
            each with a different color. The <strong>room map</strong> at the
            bottom of the screen shows your current position as a stick-figure
            icon, and a counter at the top of the screen shows the number of
            room visits remain in the game. When your character reaches a room,
            can click on the room to enter it.
        </p>

        <p>
            In each room you will play a simple card game. On the left you will
            see a face-up "best-yet" card, and on the right you will see a deck
            of face-down cards. On each visit to the room you can choose to
            either take the value on the best-yet card, or reveal a card in
            the deck and take its value.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>One third (33%) of the cards in the deck have a value of 0. The
            other two thirds (67%) have values evenly spread from 12 to 36, in
            multiples of three</strong> (in other words, 12, 15, ... 33, 36). The decks in each room are
            well-shuffled and are large enough that they won't run out of
            any card values. At the beginning of the game, the dealer in each
            room will choose a card with a value of 12, 15, or 18 as the
            starting best-yet card.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you choose the best-yet card, or you choose a card from the deck
            but its value is lower than the best-yet card, then the best-yet card will
            stay the same for your next visit to the room. But, if you pick a
            card from the deck and it's <strong>higher</strong> than the current
            best-yet card, it will <strong>replace</strong> the best-yet card.
            This means that choosing a card from the deck might sometimes lead
            to low values like 0, but it can also help you in the long run by
            improving the best-yet card.
