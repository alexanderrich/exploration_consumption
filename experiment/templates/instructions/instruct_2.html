            For the first few work periods, you will simply complete the slider task and
            move on to the next period. After a few periods, you will gain access to six
            <strong>machines</strong>. These machines won't always work, but when they do
            they will complete the next work period <strong>for you</strong>. When a machine
            completes a work period for you, you will get to spend 30 seconds playing an
            arcade game called Brickbreak instead of adjusting sliders.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Brickbreak, you use your mouse to control a paddle near the
            bottom of the screen. Your goal is to bounce a ball into rows of bricks to
            destroy them, without letting the ball fall out of the bottom of the screen. You
            will gain points for each brick you destroy. In addition, when a brick is
            destroyed it will sometimes produce a "+15" <strong>bonus brick</strong> that
            will fall down the screen. Catch this brick with your paddle for an extra 15
            points!

        <p>
            At any point in the game, you can press the "up" or "down" arrows on your
            keyboard to increase or decrease the speed of the ball. Increasing the speed
            makes the game more challenging, but also gives you more points for each brick
            destroyed. Your score will be tallied in the upper left corner of the screen.
            Each time you destroy all the bricks a new level will begin with a <strong>new
            pattern</strong> of bricks, providing new challenges and new potential
            strategies.
