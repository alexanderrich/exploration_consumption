            During the remaining time, the game will pause and you will have to
            click popup windows that appear in the center of the screen. Each
            popup window will say "<strong>Click here</strong>" until it is
            clicked. You will have 3 seconds to click each window, and after the
            three seconds elapses a new window to be clicked will immediately
            appear. For example, if you receive 4 points then after playing
            breakout for 12 seconds, you will click windows for 24 seconds and
            have to click 8 windows.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, when the ball falls out of the screen while playing
            breakout, you will have to click one window before the ball resets.
            (If your game-play time ends while the window is up, that window will
            be "cancelled" and the scheduled popups will begin.)
        </p>

        <p>
            If you occasionally do not click a window in time, you will not be
            penalized. However, if you miss more than 15% of the windows over
            the entire task, you will be penalized 5 cents from your bonus for
            each percentage over 15% that you miss. The percentage of windows
            missed will be displayed at the top of the screen.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will have an opportunity to practice through five example
            rounds of breakout and popup-clicking before the main task begins.
