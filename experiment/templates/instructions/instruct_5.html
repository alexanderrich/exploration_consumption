            There is also a one in six (17%) chance that after the machine runs it will reset itself. That means the current setting will be set
            back to a random wedge size between one third and two thirds of the spinner.

            Below the display of the six machines is a button labeled "info". If you forget
            how the machines function, click this button to toggle a set of reminders.

            You will receive a <strong>bonus of $3.00</strong> simply for accurately
            completing the slider work periods. If you occasionally do not accurately set a
            slider to 50, you will not be penalized and will receive your complete bonus
            However, <strong>you will be penalized 10 cents from your bonus for each
            percentage of sliders over 10% that you miss</strong>. (For example, if you miss
            23% of the sliders throughout the entire task, you will lose $1.30 and your
            final bonus will be $1.70.) The percentage of sliders missed will be displayed
            at the top of the screen.
