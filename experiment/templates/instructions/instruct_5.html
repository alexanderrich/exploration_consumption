            If you choose "run new spinner", a random new spinner will be created.
            The gold wedges on the new spinner can cover anywhere from <strong><span id="range"></span></strong> of its area.
            The wedge area on each new spinner is totally
            random and doesn't depend on the value of past spinners.

            After the new spinner is created, the machine will run the new
            spinner. If the new spinner is worse than the current spinner, the
            machine will then simply "forget" the new spinner and will remain on its
            current spinner for future uses. <strong>But if the new spinner is better
            than the current spinner, it will be saved and will become the current spinner
            the next time you use the machine. This means that while running a new spinner
            can be risky, it can also allow you to improve the machines so they are more
            likely to work in the future.</strong>
