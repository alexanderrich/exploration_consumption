            If you try a new setting, a random wedge will be created in the new
            setting spinner. One third (33%) of the time, the attempt to create a new
            setting will fail and the wedge will take up 0% of the spinner, meaning the
            machine will definitely not work. The other two thirds (67%) of the time, a new gold wedge
            will be created that takes up between one third (33%) of the spinner and the
            entire spinner (100%). The value of each new setting is totally
            random and doesn't depend on the value of past spinners. Below are
            some examples of randomly generated new settings
        </p>

            After the new setting is created, the machine will run the new
            setting. If the new setting is worse than the current setting, the
            machine will simply "forget" the new setting and remain on its
            current setting for future uses. <strong>But if the new setting is better
            than the current setting, it will be saved and will become the current setting
            the next time you use the machine. This means that while running a new setting
            can be risky, it can also allow you to improve the machines so they are more
            likely to work in the future.</strong>
