        <p>
            During the remaining seconds in each outcome phase, brickbreak will
            pause and you will have to click popup windows that appear in the
            center of the screen. Each popup window will say "<strong>Click
            here</strong>" until it is clicked. You will have 3 seconds to click
            each window, and after the three seconds elapses a new window to be
            clicked will immediately appear. For example, if you receive an
            outcome of 24 then after playing breakout for 24 seconds, you will
            click windows for 12 seconds and have to click 4 total windows.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, when the ball falls out of the screen while playing breakout, you
            will have to click one window before the ball resets. (If your
            game-play time ends while the window is up, that window will be
            "cancelled" with no penalty if you did not click it in time.)
        </p>

        <p>
            You will receive a bonus of $3.00 simply for staying engaged with
            the brickbreak game and the popup task. If you occasionally do not
            click a window in time, you will not be penalized and will receive
            your complete bonus. However, if you miss more than 10% of the
            windows over the entire task, you will be penalized 5 cents from
            your bonus for each percentage over 10% that you miss. (For example,
            if you miss 23% of the popups throughout the entire task, you will
            lose $1.15 and your final bonus will be $1.85.) The percentage of
            windows missed will be displayed at the top of the screen.
