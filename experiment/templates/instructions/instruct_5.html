            If you choose "run new spinner", a panel of 30 possible spinners
            will appear, as shown in the picture below.
            <strong>one third of them have no gold wedges</strong>, and always
            produce slider tasks. <strong>The remaining two thirds have gold wedges
            ranging evenly from 5% to 100%</strong> of the spinner's area. The thirty
            spinners will be briefly visible, and then will be covered up and
            <strong>randomly shuffled</strong>. You can then click any of the thirty squares in
            the panel to reveal the selected spinner.

        <p>
            After the new spinner is chosen, the machine will run the new
            spinner to produce a slider or Youtube task. If the new spinner
            is worse than the current spinner, the
            machine will then simply "forget" it and will remain on its
            current spinner for the next choice. <strong>But if the new spinner is better
            than the current spinner, it will be saved and will become the current spinner
            for your next choice. This means that while choosing a new spinner
            can be risky, it can also allow you to improve the machine so that it is more
            likely to work in the future.</strong>

        <p>
            For example, if the current spinner is half gold, then choosing a
            new spinner might lead to a spinner with no gold, making the machine
            definitely produce a slider task for this choice. But choosing a new
            spinner might also lead to a spinner that is 80% gold, giving the machine
            a high chance of producing a Youtube task for this choice and
            a high chance of producing Youtube tasks <strong>on
            future choices</strong> if you continue to select the new 80%-gold current spinner.
