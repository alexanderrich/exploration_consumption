            If you try a new setting, a random wedge will be created in the new-setting
            spinner. The new setting wedge can cover anywhere from 0% to 100% of the
            spinner. The value of each new setting is totally
            random and doesn't depend on the value of past spinners.
        </p>

        <p>
            After the new setting is created, the machine will run the new
            setting. If the new setting is worse than the current setting, the
            machine will simply "forget" the new setting after running and will remain on its
            current setting for future uses. <strong>But if the new setting is better
            than the current setting, it will be saved and will become the current setting
            the next time you use the machine. This means that while running a new setting
            can be risky, it can also allow you to improve the machines so they are more
            likely to work in the future.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if the current-setting gold wedge covers half of the
            spinner, then choosing either the current setting or a new setting
            will give you a 50% chance of the machine working. But, because a
            good new setting will be saved, choosing to try a new setting
            could increase the chance of the machine working in future uses as
            well.
