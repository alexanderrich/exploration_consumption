            You are about to begin the main part of the experiment. As explained in the instructions, you will start by completing <strong>10 pre-assigned slider tasks</strong>. However, you can <strong>turn two of these slider tasks into video tasks instead</strong>. You can either start with <span class="thing1"></span>, followed by <span class="thing2"></span>, or you can start with <span class="thing2"></span>, followed by <span class="thing1"></span> . Choose whichever option you prefer; your choice here will not affect the rest of the experiment in any way.
